# React Form Library

A modern, accessible, and type-safe form library built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Yup** for validation. This library provides a collection of reusable form components designed to streamline form creation with a consistent UI, robust validation, and seamless integration. Components include text inputs, select dropdowns, date pickers, OTP inputs, radio groups, slider checkbox, and file upload with drag-and-drop support.

The library leverages a `FormContext` to manage form state, validation, and errors, ensuring a cohesive experience across all components. It's ideal for developers building complex forms with a focus on user experience, accessibility, and developer productivity.
